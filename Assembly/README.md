# Assembly
This repository contains assembly programs which I wrote during my Computer Architecture course. Course mainly based on x86 masm, but there will be also programs using x8086 and x64 masm.

Each laboaratories focused on different aspect of programming in assembly:

  -lab2: writing texts on screen using MessageBoxW and MessageBoxA
  
  -lab3: convertions between numerical systems, simple procedures without parameters
  
  -lab4: creating procedures which are able to be used in C and C++ ( also one program using x64 )
  
  -lab5: operations using coprocessor ( float arithmetics )
  
  -lab6: hardware interrups ( handling system clock and keyboard interrupts ); x8086 using DOSbox
