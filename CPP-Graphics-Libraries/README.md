This repository contains programs from my laboratories from Computer Graphic. Most of every code is a template, that was given us by our professors. Our assignement was to create simple 2D or 3D figures that were able to move or rotate and to create some basic functionalities for keys like moving around "map" using arrow keys or changing perspective. In repository you can find laboratories from:
- Windows OpenCV
- Windows DirectX
- Windows GDI
- Windows OpenGL
- Windows SFML
- Linux Xlib
- Linux OpenGL ( need also render.cpp and render.h )

Projects will not work if you do not have downloaded libraries above, or have them in directory not configuret in project.
